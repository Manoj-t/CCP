**Basic Credit Card Processing**

This is a **Java project developed with the support of Maven** as a build automation tool to install/import any dependencies that are required. It implements Basic Credit Card Processing.


**Overview of Design Process**

- Divided this project into **three main** Java modules. They are **MainCCP.java**, **Helper.java** and **Record.java**
- **MainCCP.java** acts as a gateway to the project as it has main method from where JVM starts execution. It has sorting and summary printing aspects of the project.
- **Helper.java** contains all necessary methods such as provisioning for two types of input sources like **reading the input file**, processing each transaction like Adding new accounts, Validating card numbers against **Luhn 10 algorithm** and also process charges and credits against them.
- **Record.java** acts as a temporary persistence module in **ArrayList**. Credit card numbers for whose Luhn algorithm fails will have **erroneous** status and others will be **active** status.

**Reason for choosing Java as the programming language**

- Aspects like **ArrayList manipulations, Sorting, File IO handling mechanisms** made me to choose Java. Although it can be done in Python and other languages the familiarity with these concepts in Java made me to chose it over other languages.

**Required dependencies**

- Maven is required to build and run this project. Download maven and add it's path to the environment variable.
- Unit tests are written using **Junit4 and Mockito** frameworks. Therefore, these are the dependencies that are required to run test cases in this project.

        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.mockito</groupId>
            <artifactId>mockito-all</artifactId>
            <version>1.10.19</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>

        <dependency>
            <groupId>junit</groupId>
            <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
            <version>4.11</version>
            <scope>test</scope>
        </dependency>

**How to build and compile code**
- Open the terminal/command prompt in a folder where project is located. After that, Run the command `mvn clean install --DskipTests=true`  to clean the target, compile, build and package the project.

**How to run code and test cases**
- This program will accept input from two sources:


  **1.Filename passed as a command line argument**
In the same terminal window, run the maven command `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.ccp.MainCCP"  -Dexec.args="input.txt"`. **input.txt** file is located in the root folder of this project (CCP/input.txt) and you can edit and pass your own values.
It prints status of the accounts with names followed by balance in alphabetical order.  

**2. Input read from STDIN**

In the same terminal window, run the command  `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.ccp.MainCCP"`. Then the program prompts you to enter the input file (say **input.txt** and enter). It prints status of the accounts with names followed by balance in alphabetical order.
